/* Image Constants: for images, we define the resulting image
 size and tile size in megabytes. This translates to an amount
 of pixels. Keep in mind this is almost always significantly different
 from the size of a file on disk for compressed formats such as png, or jpeg.

 For an image to be displayed in iOS, it must first be uncompressed (decoded) from
 disk. The approximate region of pixel data that is decoded from disk is defined by both,
 the clipping rect set onto the current graphics context, and the content/image
 offset relative to the current context.

 To get the uncompressed file size of an image, use: Width x Height / pixelsPerMB, where
 pixelsPerMB = 262144 pixels in a 32bit colospace (which iOS is optimized for).
 
 Supported formats are: PNG, TIFF, JPEG. Unsupported formats: GIF, BMP, interlaced images.

#define kImageFilename @"large_leaves_70mp.jpg" // 7033x10110 image, 271 MB uncompressed

/* The arguments to the downsizing routine are the resulting image size, and
 "tile" size. And they are defined in terms of megabytes to simplify the correlation
 between images and memory footprint available to your application.
 
 The "tile" is the maximum amount of pixel data to load from the input image into
 memory at one time. The size of the tile defines the number of iterations
 required to piece together the resulting image.
 
 Choose a resulting size for your image given both: the hardware profile of your
 target devices, and the amount of memory taken by the rest of your application.
 
 Maximizing the source image tile size will minimize the time required to complete
 the downsize routine. Thus, performance must be balanced with resulting image quality.
 
 Choosing appropriate resulting image size and tile size can be done, but is left as
 an exercise to the developer. Note that the device type/version string
 (e.g. "iPhone2,1" can be determined at runtime through use of the sysctlbyname function:

 size_t size;
 sysctlbyname("hw.machine", NULL, &size, NULL, 0);
 char *machine = malloc(size);
 sysctlbyname("hw.machine", machine, &size, NULL, 0);
 NSString* _platform = [NSString stringWithCString:machine encoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding];
 free(machine);

 These constants are suggested initial values for iPad1, and iPhone 3GS */
